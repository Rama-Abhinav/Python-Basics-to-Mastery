Problem Statement — “Animal Talk” 🐾

    You’re designing a simple animal simulator.

    All animals can speak, but each species speaks differently.

    You need to create a base class Animal with a method speak().

    Create three different animal classes (Dog, Cat, and Parrot) that inherit from Animal and override speak() with their own sounds.

    Write a function animal_sounds(animals_list) that:

    Accepts a list of animals (mixed types: dogs, cats, parrots…)

    Loops through each animal and calls speak()

    Show polymorphism in action: the same speak() method call should produce different results depending on the object’s class.
