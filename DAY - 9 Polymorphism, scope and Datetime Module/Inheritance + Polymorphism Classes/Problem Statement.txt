Problem Statement — “Shape Area Calculator” 📐
You need to create a program that calculates the area of different shapes using inheritance and method overriding (polymorphism).

Requirements
    Create a base class Shape with:

        A method area() that just has pass inside.

    Create three child classes:

        Rectangle → takes width and height as input when created.
        Overrides area() to return width * height.

        Circle → takes radius as input when created.
        Overrides area() to return 3.14 * radius * radius.

        Triangle → takes base and height as input when created.
        Overrides area() to return 0.5 * base * height.

    Write a function print_areas(shapes_list) that:

        Loops through all shapes in the list

        Calls .area() on each shape

        Prints the result

    Test it with a list containing different shapes mixed together and show that the same .area() call works for all shapes.

Sample Output:-
    Rectangle area: 20
    Circle area: 78.5
    Triangle area: 10.0
