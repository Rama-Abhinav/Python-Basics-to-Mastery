📝 Problem Statement — “Student Report Generator”
You are given a JSON string containing information about a few students and their marks in three subjects.

Your task:

    Parse the JSON string into a Python object.

    Calculate each student’s average marks.

    Create a new JSON object containing:

    Student’s name

    Average marks (rounded to 2 decimal places)

    A grade based on the average:

    A → avg ≥ 90

    B → 75 ≤ avg < 90

    C → 50 ≤ avg < 75

    F → avg < 50

    Convert the result back to a JSON string (formatted with indentation) and print it.
