Problem: Extract valid email addresses from a list of strings

Youâ€™re given the following Python list:
    data = [
        "Contact us at support@example.com",
        "Send mail to info@my-site.org or sales@my-site.org",
        "This is not an email: test@.com",
        "admin@company123.net is the admin email",
        "Reach us at user.name@sub.domain.co.in for support"
    ]

Your Task

    Write a regex pattern that matches only valid emails in this list.

    Your regex should:

        Start with letters, digits, dots (.), underscores (_), or hyphens (-).

        Contain an @ symbol.

        Have a valid domain name (letters, digits, hyphens, dots).

        End with a valid top-level domain (e.g., .com, .org, .net, .co.in, etc.).

    Print all matching emails as a list.
